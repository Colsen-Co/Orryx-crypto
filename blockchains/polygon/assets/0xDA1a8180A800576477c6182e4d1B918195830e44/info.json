TWT Acquiring:

Trust Wallet Tokens (TWT) can be obtained from DEXs/exchanges.
TWT-BEP20 can be traded with TWT-BEP2 using the Trust Wallet Swap Option.
Notes:

New tokens without significant usage are rejected, see criteria mentioned above.
One PR should be for a single project; PR's with more than 10 logos will be rejected.
Payment evaluation happens automatically, but with a few minutes delay. When payment is detected, an Accept Review is automatically placed on the PR, which is a condition for merge.
Evaluating the PR is done manually, and it is merged only if all conditions are satisfied.
There will be a fee to process this request. None of it goes to the developers.
